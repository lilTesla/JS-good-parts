IF SOME KIND OF MISUNDERSTANDING HAPPENS, THIS IS FIRST PLACE TO LOOK FOR EXPLANATIONS
MISTAKES ARE SORTED BY CHAPTERS

FUNCTIONS
    1. Closing works not only in functions as is said in the beginning of the chapter, but in objects too. See "closure.js".
    2. Another mistake, in the "Arguments" section. In code example's comments it is said that function sees only the inner one variable,
    but it is happening only because it has the same name as outer one. In general, it encloses the outer variable.
